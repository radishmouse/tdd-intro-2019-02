# What is TDD?

- Stands for "Test Driven Development"
- Associated with Agile software development methodology.

# How does it work?

- you write user stories (kanban board cards)
- you write tests that describe the desired outcome
- you run the tests, which of course fail
- you write just enough code to make one test pass
- wash, rinse, repeat

# Why do we do it?

- To make sure we don't break features as we add on new features

# Isn't it slower?

- After you build the habit, it pays off later

# Aren't there other kinds of tests?

- Integration Tests (a.k.a. end-to-end tests)
- Acceptance Tests (User Acceptance tests)

# How do we do TDD?

- install mocha
- write a very simple test case

## How/when do we install the software?

- you install mocha once per computer
- you create tests files for every project
